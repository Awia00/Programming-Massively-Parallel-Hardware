## Task 3

See CUDA folder for implementation.

8000*8000 matrices.

Running Times:
    MMM naive time           11
    MMM optimized time       12

Gigaflops:
    MMM gigaFlops naive      93090913.512490
    MMM gigaFlops optimized  85333337.386449

Again naive is faster than the optimized. Probably due to a fault in the implementation.
