## Task 1

See cuda folder for implementation

5000*5000 matrix

Running time:
    M-transpose naive time           55
    M-transpose optimized time       59

Which weirdly enough is very close to eachother. Some results also indicate a faster optimized version but in average they are very equal. This is probably due to some implementation error or the GPU01 nvidia driver.
